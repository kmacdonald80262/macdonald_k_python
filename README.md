# Rock Paper Scissors in Python!

### Pick your weapon and play against the computer -  you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play.

Clone the project, navigate to the correct directory - <code>cd directory name</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python 3 Terminal window for mac/ Linux.

The rules are the same as the classic game:

1. Paper covers Rock
2. Scissors cuts Paper
3. Rock smashes Scissors

_**Choose your weapon wisely!**_

**First person to 3 victories wins the game!**

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.
